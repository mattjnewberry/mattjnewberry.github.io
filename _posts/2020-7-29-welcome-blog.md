title: Welcome To Matthew's Project Repository

This website serves as a portfolio for my personal projects, mainly using AWS, as I attempt to document the development and architecture of my AWS infrastructure.
Each project will include a written blog including technical details and challenges, hopefully acting as a learning resource for others (and for my future self!).

For more infromation about me, the author, or any questions regarding these projects, please reach out to me using the contact information in the <a href="../about">about</a> section and I'd be happy to discuss further.
