This website serves as a portfolio for my personal projects, mainly using AWS, as I attempt to document the development and architecture of my AWS infrastructure. 
Each project will include technical details and challenges, hopefully acting as a learning resource for others (and for my future self!).

For any questions regarding these projects, please reach out to me using the contact information in the <a href="about">about</a> section and I'd be happy to discuss further.
