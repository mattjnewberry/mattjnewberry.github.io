This website serves as a portfolio for my personal projects, mainly using AWS, as I attempt to document the development and architecture of my AWS infrastructure. 
Each project will include technical details and challenges, hopefully acting as a learning resource for others (and for my future self!).


For any questions regarding these projects, please reach out to me via using the contact section and I'd be happy to discuss further.
